# OTAR3088: Automated Knowledge Extraction for Biomedical Literature

This repository hosts the codebase and resources for the OTAR3088 project â€” a collaborative initiative between [Europe PMC (EPMC)](https://europepmc.org), [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/), and [Open Targets](https://www.opentargets.org/).

The project aims to modernise and extend the existing Named Entity Recognition (NER) workflows used by EPMC and Open Targets to cover a broader range of biomedical entities relevant to drug discovery â€” including variants, biomarkers, tissues/cell types, adverse events, and assay conditions.

By incorporating these new entity types, the project seeks to provide higher confidence in the relevance of targetâ€“disease associations and enhance downstream knowledge extraction and integration

---

## Key Objectives
- Extend existing NER pipelines to support new biomedical entity types.
- Develop a modular, flexible framework that enables easy replacement or integration of new NLP models and datasets as they become available.
- Explore and benchmark modern NLP architectures (e.g., Transformer-based models) and advanced fine-tuning techniques for biomedical text mining.
