    "\n",
    "- Run through demoing our new cellate model, showing promise of adding insight into promise of therapeutic targets\n",
    "- We can consider times where cell specificity is crucial for the complete understanding of a target's function in a given disease\n",
    "    - Big examples seen in recent years include: \n",
    "        - the different roles of APOE in Alzheimer's disease, depending on their context - microglia, neurons\n",
    "        - PD-1 in CD8+ T cells vs. TREG cells in cancer\n",
    "    - Links to one of our therapeutic hypoethsis Qs:\n",
    "        - _\"What is the function of target [y] in cell type [d] in disease [x]?\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "- As an OTs user, we can search for the target PDCD1 (~ PD-1), seeing in these results high associations with many types of cancer, including NSCLC.\n",
    "    - https://partner-platform.opentargets.org/target/ENSG00000188389/associations\n",
    "- Supporting evidence here currently links cooccurences of the target _PD-1_ to the disease _NSCLC_, but:\n",
    "    - We can see that the literature already contains cell-type specific information\n",
    "    - Our data as it stands doesn't reflcct this - potential therapeutic insights are buried here, but aren't specifically captured\n",
    "- OpenAI even gives us a nod, stating \"Specific information about PDCD1 would require additional _context_ / sources\""
